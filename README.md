# echo_generation_cancellation_system
This project uses the basics of signals and systems to develop a program that takes a sound file, and adds an echo to it, with a certain attenuation factor and delay that can be adjusted. The project also is capable of cancelling that echo and returning the original file back.
The projects support finite and infinite echo
